This is just a simple mod that makes some fun tweaks/retextures to RA Base Building Mod for Dayz

- Adds a fun retexture of the box. With my KZ Logo and Apple II logo on the outside of the box kit
- Adds a fun retexture of the Apple computer, giving it some text on screen as well and a small RA logo. It also adds a KZ sticker to the side
- Also removes the old recipe for crafting a TerritoryHQ Kit and just adds the proper text, to avoid player confusion when crafting. Doesnt change the recipe at all, just the name.
- Adds a recipe to pack the TerritoryHQ with a screwdriver or pliers. Must be empty for this to work.

- Lastly, I attempted to remove the upgrade slots, since they aren't currently used. But they still persist and must exist somewhere else in the base mod that I cannot find. Will likely just revert those changes as to not cause problems in the future.
